# 🚀 Modern Data Lakehouse on Databricks using Medallion Architecture

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable Modern Data Lakehouse using Databricks, PySpark, Spark SQL, and Delta Lake following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

The solution ingests raw ERP and CRM datasets from CSV files, transforms them through multiple processing layers, and delivers business-ready dimensional models optimized for analytics and reporting.

The project also includes automated orchestration using Databricks Workflows, enabling end-to-end execution from data ingestion to Gold layer creation.

# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern:

## Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

* Ingest ERP and CRM CSV datasets.
* Store raw data in Delta format.
* Preserve source data with minimal transformations.
* Maintain auditability and traceability.

## Silver Layer (Cleansed & Conformed Data)

* Data quality validation.
* Standardization of formats and values.
* Null handling and cleansing.
* Deduplication.
* Business rule implementation.
* Creation of six curated Silver tables.

## Gold Layer (Business Layer)

Business-ready dimensional models optimized for analytics.

### Dimension Tables

* Dim Customer
* Dim Product

### Fact Tables

* Fact Sales
